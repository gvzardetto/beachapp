# Fix Database Permissions

## Issue
The match update functionality shows success but doesn't actually update the database because the Supabase database is missing UPDATE and DELETE policies.

## Solution
You need to run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to add the missing permissions:

```sql
-- Add update and delete permissions for matches table
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- Drop existing policies first
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access on matches" ON matches;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public insert access on matches" ON matches;

-- Create comprehensive policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access on matches" ON matches
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert access on matches" ON matches
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public update access on matches" ON matches
  FOR UPDATE USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public delete access on matches" ON matches
  FOR DELETE USING (true);

-- Test the permissions
SELECT 'Permissions updated successfully' as status;
```

## Steps to Fix:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the SQL above
4. Click "Run" to execute the SQL
5. You should see "Permissions updated successfully" in the results

## What This Fixes:

- ✅ Match updates will now actually update the database
- ✅ Match deletions will work properly
- ✅ All CRUD operations will function correctly
- ✅ The frontend will reflect real database changes

## Verification:

After running the SQL, test the following:
1. Create a new match
2. Edit an existing match
3. Delete a match
4. Check that changes persist in the database

The issue was that Row Level Security (RLS) was enabled on the matches table, but only SELECT and INSERT policies were created. UPDATE and DELETE operations were being blocked by the security policies.
